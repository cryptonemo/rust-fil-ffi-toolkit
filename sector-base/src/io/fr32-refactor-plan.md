## Refactoring plan for the `fr32` module

- [x] `next_fr_end`, along with `target_offsets` it completes the methods that process the padded/unpadded position, which are always the first methods that call the write functions.

- [x] Refactor `write_padded_aux`. Move the call to `write_padded_aligned` at the end, unifying both cases, and setting the correct last two arguments (the first 3 are the same), that will prepare it to be merged with `write_padded_aligned`. Everything before the `write_padded_aligned` call should be the logic to align the persisted data.

- [x] Should we always call the `write_padded_aligned` function? Is there a case where we don't have enough to byte align the persisted padded data to prepare for it? It wouldn't seem so, the input raw data (byte-aligned) is always bigger than zero (check that), hence it's always bigger than 8 bits, with 7 being the maximum needed to byte align.

- [N] The whole concept of byte aligning may be unnecessary altogether, what we care about is reaching the element boundary, then we can write whole chunks of `data_chunk_bits` and pad directly (as its done at the end of `write_padded_aligned`), that should take the center of the write logic (the bye aligning, even if needed, could/should be handled separately). ANSWER: We need this because we operate (pad) at the bit level but we write at the byte level and we need an exclusive logic to handle that transition (incomplete last byte case).

- [x] Review `write_unpadded_aux`. Much of the logic and insight from `write_padded_aligned` should be applicable here.

- [x] Evaluate reworking `next_element_boundary` to give distance and not position (see `TODO`).

- [ ] Leave this for last: go to the lower levels of the of bit/byte positions transformation logic (only after resolving the higher level logic of the write functions), review and document `transform_bit_pos` and `transform_byte_pos` functions. It should be clear why the work the way they do, based on the `PaddingMap` invariants. They seem to be correct, but in a implicit and subtle way: they handle the padding case, and its inverse, unpadding, with the same logic; there's a symmetry that draws my attention that I'm not sure I can explain clearly.

- [ ] Final review and formatting to the `PaddingMap` documentation.
